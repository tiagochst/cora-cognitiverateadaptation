#summary Building OpenWRT.

= Introduction =

We are going to explain how to build an Openwrt custom firmware to use CORA algorithm.


= Step by Step =

== Obtaining OpenWRT ==
First of all, make a checkout of OpenWRT repository (Backfire 10.03.1-rc4 -  revision 24045).
{{{
svn checkout --revision=24045 svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/backfire/ ./build_dir
}}}

Secondly, update and install the pakages to same version (revision 24045)
To do that:

 * copy feeds.conf.default in ./build_dir to feeds.conf 
 * Add "@24045" at the end of the line that checks out the package feed:
 It should look like this:
 {{{
    src-svn packages svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages@24045
 }}}
* Update packages doing:
  {{{
   ./scripts/feeds update -a
   }}}
* Install the packages doing:
  {{{
    ./scripts/feeds install -a
  }}}


== Configuring OpenWRT ==
To access openwrt configuration do:
   {{{
    make menuconfig
   }}}
Be careful!! You should use an appropriate configuration for your device.
Look on openwrt's site for help.

}}}
